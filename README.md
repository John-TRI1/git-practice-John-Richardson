I've been using computers for 17 years. 


============================

I've learned that I now know how to pull, revert, and commit data within my GitHub repository and other individual repositories. I've learned how I can resolve conflict errors and how to cause them as well.

===========================================================


In the collaboration, I was able to modify their repository and send it back with the modifications I had made. I also used my README.md for my conflict errors as well.
