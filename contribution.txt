Assuming short term goal number 3 is referring to Bench Press, here's a routine I've started using to improve mine. 

You take about 65% of your current pr on you do 3 reps of that for 10 sets with about a 90 second interval between sets. Then on your next chest day you move that up by 5 pounds and do the same again.
If you fail to do 10 sets of 3, then go down to 9 sets, or 8, or however many you can do and keep going up. Once you are only capable of doing 1 set of 3 of a specific weight, you can put it into a calculator like on this website:

And calculate your 1 rep max. This is a method of getting a new max without putting too much strain on yourself. At 225, I would personally still try and go for 225 once I think I could get it, but as you go up in weight this just lessens the chance of tearing a muscle.
