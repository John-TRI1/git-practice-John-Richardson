So what I had some issues on was figuring out how to do a merge conflict resolution. What I was doing was making a change on my feature-addition branch and then proceeding to just commit it which didn't cause any conflicts.
What I needed to do was change the same file on both ends so change it on main and change it on feature-addition. Why I didn't realize it was this easy was because I was under the assumption that the two had been merged. 
IF they had been merged like it had been telling me regardless of making changes at all I would have never had any conflicts.
